# Final-UCF-Project

The purpose of my section of the project is to decide which technologies we'll use. Additionally, I'll write the ReadMe and summarize the results of our two models, and the corresponding statistical and analytical concepts. Finally, I'll be responsible for creating the presentation. 

## Machine Learning Model

Once the data has been cleaned, we'll standardize it and use it as a base for our machine learning model. We'll then separate the data into training and testing sets before finally applying a Machine Learning Model (Which will be used?)
