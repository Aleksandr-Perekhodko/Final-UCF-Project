## Data Cleaning
I conducted the same data cleaning techniques as Mohammed to keep things consistent throughout the analysis.

These columns were: 'Alley', 'Fence', 'FireplaceQu', 'LotFrontage', 'MiscFeature', 'PoolQC'. This resulted in a total of 76 columns.

## Database Creation and Storage
I decided to connect Pandas and SQL with the sqlalchemy module. Using the cleaned data, I created a database on pgAdmin to the local server. 
A scheme file is provided to provide information on the creation of the other tables and csv files. They conincide with the data visualizations created by Aleks, showing comparisions of average price/sqft to overal quality of the home.
