## Data Cleaning
I conducted the same data cleaning techniques as Mohammed to keep things consistent throughout the analysis.

These columns were: 'Alley', 'Fence', 'FireplaceQu', 'LotFrontage', 'MiscFeature', 'PoolQC'. This resulted in a total of 76 columns.

## Database Creation and Storage
I decided to connect Pandas and SQL with the sqlalchemy module. Using the cleaned data, I created a database on pgAdmin to the local server. 
A scheme file is to come.
