# Final-UCF-Project

The purpose of our analysis is to examine real estate trends and data in Ames, Iowa to determine if we can accurately predict the final price for each home in our data set. In order to do so, we'll employ a variety of techniques, including data exraction and cleaning, using a NoSQL Database to store our data, and performing Primary Component Analysis(PCA) to ready the data for a machine learning model before finally presenting our findings in Tableau (or other visualization applications).

Additionally, weâ€™ll be asking the following questions of our data:

- If housing prices are expected to rise, how much would the average price increase be? 
- 
- Are there any outliers in our data? And if so, how should we treat them?
- Are the any other factors that haven't been considered in our analysis?

# Methodology

Following the roadmap we'll assign tasks accordingly.
